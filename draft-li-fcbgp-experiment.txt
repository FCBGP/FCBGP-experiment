      Forwarding Commitment BGP Testbed and Deployment Experience
                    draft-li-fcbgp-experiment-latest

Abstract

   Forwarding Commitment BGP（FC-BGP） is capable of establishing a secure
   inter-domain system that can simultaneously authenticate AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE and validate network forwarding on the
   dataplane.  In an effort to enhance the validation of FC-BGP, a
   prototype implementation of the FC-BGP was developed and an
   evaluation was conducted on the FITI high-performance IPv6 backbone
   network.  This document reports on the prototype implementation and
   the results of the evaluation.

3.  FC-BGP Overview

   AS(65536) --> AS(65537) --> AS(65538)
                         \
                          \--> AS(65539)

              Figure 1: An FC-BGP UPDATE propagation example.

   It is important to note that this example only introduces important
   steps here and see xxxxx for details.  What's more, here ASes are
   global AS and not RS or AS Confederation.  No ASPP is taken into
   consideration.

   For the sake of discussion, we assume that AS 65537 receives an FC-
   BGP UPDATE message for prefix 192.0.2.0/24 from AS 65536 and will
   send the route to AS 65538 and AS 65539 as Figure 1 shows.  An FC-BGP
   speaker SHOULD propagate an FC-BGP UPDATE message to downstream ASes
   only after completing the validation and best route path selection.

   When the FC-BGP speaker in AS 65536 plans to propagate routes to its
   downstream AS 65537, it fills the FC path attribute first.  The PASN
   is 0/NULL, the CASN is 65536, and the NASN is 65537.  Then it
   calculates the signature, fills the FC, and forms the FC path
   attribute and FC-BGP UPDATE message.  Then, it sends the UPDATE
   message out.

   When receiving an UPDATE message from AS 65536, the FC-BGP speaker in
   AS 65537 retrieves the FC path attribute and extracts the FC list.
   It then finds the FC with CASN == 65536 as the AS_PATH has only one
   AS(65536) and checks whether PASN is 0 as well as NASN is 65537.  If
   so, it uses the SKI field to find the public key and calculates the
   signature using the algorithm specified in the Algorithm ID.  If the
   calculated signature matches the signature in the FC segment, then
   the AS-Path hop associated with the AS 65536 is verified.  This
   process repeats for all FCs and AS-Paths in the FC list if it has
   other ASes in AS_PATH.  However, if AS 65537 does not support FC-BGP,
   the BGP speaker of AS 65537 simply forwards the BGP UPDATE to its
   neighbors when propagating this FC-BGP route without validating the
   FC path attribute.

   FC-BGP speakers need to generate different UPDATE messages for
   different neighbors.  Each UPDATE announcement contains only one
   route prefix and cannot be aggregated.  This is because different
   route prefixes may have different announcement paths due to different
   routing policies.  Multiple aggregated route prefixes may cause FC
   generation and verification errors.  When multiple route prefixes
   need to be announced, the FC-BGP speaker needs to generate different
   UPDATE messages for each route prefix.  Thus, the FC-BGP speaker of
   AS 65537 generates different UPDATE messages for AS 65538 and AS
   65539 separately.  The biggest difference is that the NASN is 65538
   for AS 65538 and 65539 for AS 65539 in the FC segment generated by AS
   65537.

   Take AS 65538 as the next hop.  The FC-BGP speaker in AS 65537 will
   encapsulate each prefix to be sent to AS 65538 in a single UPDATE
   message, add the FC path attribute, and sign the path content using
   its private key to fill a new FC segment.  The FC path attribute and
   the FC segment use the message format shown in xxxx and xxxxx
   separately.  When signing, the FC-BGP speaker computes the SHA256
   hash in the order of (PASN ( 0 if absent), CASN, NASN, IP Prefix
   Address, and IP Prefix Length) first.  Next, the FC-BGP speaker
   should calculate the digest information Digest, sign the Digest with
   ECDSA, and then fill in the Signature field and other FC fields.
   After that, AS 65537 prepends its own FC on top of the FC List.  At
   this point, the processing of FC path attributes by the FC-BGP
   speaker is complete.  The subsequent processing of BGP messages
   follows the standard BGP process.

4.  FC-BGP Testbed

4.1.  Implementation Status

   We implement the FC-BGP mechanism with FRR version 9.0.1.  The
   implementation includes verifying the FC path attribute upon
   receiving BGP UPDATE messages and adding and signing the FC path
   attribute when sending BGP UPDATE messages.  The development and
   testing of this implementation were conducted on Ubuntu 22.04 with
   OpenSSL 3.X installed.

   GitHub repository: https://github.com/fcbgp/fcbgp-impl

4.2.  FITI

   The prototypes of our solutions for FC-BGP are implemented and tested
   on FITI (Future Internet Technology Infrastructure).  FITI is a major
   Chinese science and technology infrastructure investment, which is
   now under construction and operation by 40 universities, including
   the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of
   Education and Tsinghua University.  FITI holds 4096 Autonomous System
   Numbers (ASNs) assigned by APNIC, along with a 240a:a000::/20 IPv6
   address block.  With sites distributed across China, it features a
   genuine internet environment suitable for large-scale network
   experimentation.  FITI supports a maximum bandwidth of up to 1.2
   Tbps.

5.  Test Experience and Results

   Utilizing public datasets from RouteViews, we performed Internet BGP
   topology reconstruction and BGP announcement replay on the Testbed.
   Simultaneously, we adjusted the deployment ratio of FC-BGP to
   calculate the network-wide route hijackability rate under partial
   deployment scenarios as the deployment rate increases.

   Given a deployment rate r, we randomly select the r% ASes to upgrade
   any one of FC-BGP and BGPsec.  We randomly select two ASes, A as the
   victim and B as the attacker.  AS B initiates origin prefix hijacking
   of AS A to all other ASes in the topology and computes the proportion
   of ASes that can be hijacked denoted as p.  This process is repeated
   10,000 times, and the average value of p is computed as the origin
   hijacking rate at the current deployment rate r.  We obtained the
   experimental result: With a deployment rate of only 10%, over 70% of
   Internet BGP paths can be protected.
