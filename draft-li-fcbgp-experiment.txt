      Forwarding Commitment BGP Testbed and Deployment Experience
                    draft-li-fcbgp-experiment-latest

Abstract

   Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP) enables the establishment of a
   secure inter-domain routing system by providing security for the path
   of Autonomous Systems (ASs) through which a BGP UPDATE message
   passes.  In an effort to enhance the validation of FC-BGP, a
   prototype implementation of the FC-BGP was developed and an
   evaluation was conducted on the FITI high-performance IPv6 backbone
   network.  This document reports on the prototype implementation and
   the results of the evaluation.

1.  Introduction

   The current inter-domain routing system lacks a mechanism in BGP to
   ensure the authenticity of path attributes announced by an Autonomous
   System (AS).  This deficiency exposes a broad attack surface and
   enables risks such as traffic interception, denial-of-service, and
   man-in-the-middle attacks[RFC4272].Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP)
   is a novel forwarding-path verification framework designed to address
   these security challenges inherent in today's inter-domain routing
   system.  By introducing a Forwarding Commitment (FC), FC-BGP offers a
   solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing routing
   infrastructure.  Through the use of FCs to provide a verifiable view
   of routing intent, FC-BGP ensures that the actual forwarding path
   conforms to declared routing policies.

   As part of the development of the Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP)
   framework, we implemented a FC-BGP prototype and deployed the
   prototype in the operational networks of 40 Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   within the Future Internet Technology Infrastructure (FITI).  The
   evaluation demonstrates that FC-BGP achieves significant performance
   improvements in large-scale network deployments and that even limited
   deployment yields substantial security benefits.  This document first
   describes a FC-BGP prototype solution, then outlines the experimental
   environment, and finally presents the experimental results.  It is
   anticipated that this document will provide useful insights for those
   interested in this subject and serve as preliminary input for future
   IETF work in this area.

3.  A Prototype FC-BGP Implementation

   AS(65536) --> AS(65537) --> AS(65538)
                         \
                          \--> AS(65539)

              Figure 1: An FC-BGP UPDATE propagation example.

   This section describes a prototype implementation of FC-BGP, using a
   simplified topology as illustrated in Figure 1.  Only the essential
   operations are highlighted here; readers are referred to
   [FC-BGP-Protocol] for the complete protocol specification.

   In this example, all Autonomous Systems (ASes) are standard ASes;
   Route Servers (RSes) and AS Confederations are not considered.
   Additionally, no AS Path Protection (ASPP) mechanisms are applied.

   For the purposes of discussion, it is assumed that:

   1.  AS 65536 owns the prefix 192.0.2.0/24.

   2.  AS 65537 receives an FC-BGP UPDATE message for the prefix
       192.0.2.0/24 from AS 65536.

   3.  AS 65537 then propagates the route to AS 65538 and AS 65539.

   An FC-BGP speaker SHOULD propagate an FC-BGP UPDATE message to
   downstream ASs only after completing the validation and best route
   path selection.

3.1.  FC Generation at the Originating AS

   When preparing to propagate a route, the FC-BGP speaker in AS 65536
   performs the following steps:

   1.  Constructs the FC segment:

       Sets the Previous AS Number (PASN) to 0 (NULL).

       Sets the Current AS Number (CASN) to 65536.

       Sets the Next AS Number (NASN) to 65537.

   2.  Computes the signature as follows: Signature=ECDSA(SHA256(PASN,
       CASN, NASN, Prefix, Prefix Length)).

   3.  Constructs the FC Path attribute by embedding the newly generated
       FC segment.

   4.  Encapsulates the route announcement in a BGP UPDATE message and
       transmits it to AS 65537.

3.2.  FC Verification at the Receiving AS

   Upon receiving the UPDATE message, the FC-BGP speaker in AS 65537:

   1.  Extracts the FC Path attribute.

   2.  Retrieves the list of FC segments.

   3.  Identifies the FC segment where CASN == 65536.

   4.  Verifies that:

       PASN == 0.

       NASN == 65537.

   5.  Retrieves the corresponding public key using the Subject Key
       Identifier (SKI) field.

   6.  Verifies the signature using the algorithm indicated by the
       Algorithm ID field.

   If the signature matches, the AS hop from 65536 to 65537 is
   considered verified.  This process repeats for each FC segment
   corresponding to the AS_PATH entries if applicable.

   If AS 65537 does not support FC-BGP, its BGP speaker MUST propagate
   the UPDATE message without validating the FC Path attribute.

3.3.  FC Generation at Intermediate ASes

   An FC-BGP speaker MUST generate a distinct UPDATE message for each
   downstream neighbor.  Each UPDATE message MUST announce only a single
   IP prefix and MUST NOT aggregate multiple prefixes.

   This restriction is necessary because different prefixes may follow
   different routing policies, resulting in different Forwarding
   Commitments.  Aggregating prefixes could cause errors in FC
   generation and validation.

   Thus, AS 65537 generates:

   An UPDATE message for AS 65538 with NASN set to 65538.

   A separate UPDATE message for AS 65539 with NASN set to 65539.

   For each UPDATE to a downstream neighbor (e.g., AS 65538), the FC-BGP
   speaker in AS 65537:

   1.  Encapsulates the route prefix into a single UPDATE message.

   2.  Constructs a new FC segment:

       Sets the Previous AS Number (PASN) to 65536.

       Sets the Current AS Number (CASN) to 65537.

       Sets the Next AS Number (NASN) to 65538.

       Computes the SHA-256 digest over (PASN, CASN, NASN, IP Prefix
       Address, IP Prefix Length).

       Signs the digest using ECDSA.

       Fills in the Signature and other required FC fields.

   3.  Prepends the newly created FC segment to the existing FC List.

   4.  Completes the FC Path attribute.

   5.  Continues with standard BGP UPDATE processing and transmission.

4.  FC-BGP Testbed

4.1.  FITI

   The prototypes of our solutions for FC-BGP are implemented and tested
   on Future Internet Technology Infrastructure(FITI).  FITI is a major
   scientific and technological infrastructure project in China,
   constructed and operated by the National Development and Reform
   Commission, the Ministry of Education, Tsinghua University, and other
   participating universities.  The FITI high-performance backbone
   network connects 40 universities across 35 cities in 31 provinces,
   autonomous regions, and municipalities, with backbone links
   supporting bandwidths of up to 1.2 Tbps.  FITI has been assigned 4096
   Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) by APNIC, along with a
   240a:a000::/20 IPv6 address block.  With geographically distributed
   sites across China, FITI provides a genuine internet environment
   suitable for large-scale network experimentation.

4.2.  FC-BGP Testbed on FITI Infrastructure

   The FC-BGP testbed was deployed on the FITI backbone network, as
   illustrated in Figure 2.  FITI provides a network environment
   comprising 40 interconnected ASes located in cities such as Beijing,
   Shanghai, Nanjing, and Shenzhen.  These ASes are capable of running
   the BGP protocol, support customizable routing policies, and reflect
   realistic physical and geographical topologies.  Each AS can host
   multiple routers.  The FC-BGP mechanism was implemented in 31 of the
   ASes, including deployment on commercial H3C CR16000 or CR19000
   routers in a subset of them.  After software updates, these 31 ASes
   were fully FC-BGP-enabled, supporting route exchange as well as FC
   attribute transmission and reception.  The remaining 9 ASes did not
   deploy FC-BGP and were used to construct a partial deployment
   scenario.The testbed is fully capable of supporting the evaluation
   requirements for the FC-BGP solution.

5.  Test Experience and Results

   The prototype implementation of FC-BGP, as described in Section 2,
   was deployed on the testbed outlined in Section 3.  The functionality
   of the FC-BGP prototype and its compatibility under partial
   deployment scenarios were evaluated.  All features were successfully
   tested, as detailed in the experimental results presented in this
   section.

5.1.  Test Experience

   1.  Functional testing of FC-BGP is conducted to verify the
       protocol's compliance with its specification in terms of message
       construction and operational behavior.  The evaluation focuses on
       verifying that a BGP speaker is able to correctly construct BGP
       UPDATE messages containing the FC path attribute and that the
       message format conforms to the FC-BGP specification.  In
       addition, the tests validate that the FC-BGP implementation
       correctly performs AS path validation procedures.

            Figure 2: FC-BGP Testbed on FITI Infrastructure.

   1.  To assess the effectiveness and compatibility of FC-BGP in
       partial deployment scenarios, a testbed is constructed consisting
       of routers that support the FC-BGP mechanism and intermediate
       routers that do not support it.  The goal of the testing is to
       confirm that routers without FC-BGP mechanism support can
       transparently forward BGP UPDATE messages containing FC path
       attributes without discarding or altering them.  This ensures
       that FC path attributes are preserved even when traversing BGP
       routers that do not support the FC-BGP mechanism.

   2.  Evaluate the compatibility of the FC-BGP prototype device in a
       variety of network scenarios.  Verify the routing processing
       capabilities of the FC-BGP device under different address
       families, including IPv4 and IPv6.  Test the compatibility of the
       FC-BGP prototype device, when functioning as a BGP route
       reflector (RR) and RR client, in networks composed of commercial
       routers from different vendors.

5.2.  Test Results

   1.  The test results indicated that the FC-BGP prototype correctly
       implemented the functionalities as defined in the protocol
       specification [FC-BGP-Protocol].  All FC-BGP-enabled BGP speakers
       were able to successfully generate FC-BGP UPDATE messages that
       conformed to the protocol specification, and the receiving AS was
       able to correctly perform the path validation procedure.  The FC
       path validation mechanism functioned as intended, verifying each
       hop in the AS_PATH sequentially.  In scenarios where the
       receiving AS did not support FC-BGP, the system was still able to
       forward FC-BGP UPDATE messages without disruption.

   2.  Under partial deployment conditions, FC-BGP demonstrated good
       compatibility with legacy BGP routers.  Commercial routers from
       different vendors that do not support FC-BGP (such as Huawei and
       Ruijie) were able to transparently forward UPDATE messages
       containing FC path attributes, and the integrity of these
       messages was preserved throughout the forwarding process.  These
       results suggest that FC-BGP supports incremental deployment and
       remains compatible with existing BGP implementations.  With
       respect to partial deployment, Section 5.1.1 of [FC-ARXIV]
       demonstrates that an adversary cannot forge a valid AS path when
       FC-BGP is fully deployed.  Furthermore, Section 5.1.2 of
       [FC-ARXIV] analyzes the advantages of FC-BGP in partial
       deployment scenarios.  The analysis shows that FC-BGP offers
       greater security benefits than BGPsec under partial deployment
       conditions.

   3.  The test results indicated that the FC-BGP prototype device was
       capable of correctly receiving and processing routing information
       for all supported address families.  When operating as a BGP RR,
       the FC-BGP prototype device correctly reflected both IPv4 and
       IPv6 routes to its clients.  Additionally, when acting as a BGP
       RR client, the FC-BGP prototype device was able to properly
       receive routes from the RR.  These results demonstrate that the
       FC-BGP prototype device exhibits strong compatibility across a
       variety of network scenarios.

6.  Conclusion

   In conclusion, experimental results demonstrate that:

   1.  FC-BGP offers efficient and scalable AS path verification while
       preserving compatibility and stability with existing routing
       protocols.  These advantages are achieved without the need for
       modifications to the current Internet architecture.

   2.  Incremental deployment is a key design principle that was used in
       the experiment.  The results indicate that, even with partial
       deployment, FC-BGP provides significant security benefits in
       protecting routing information, encouraging early adoption of the
       solution by service providers.

7.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to report FC-BGP testbed and
   experimental results.  Security considerations related to the
   solution mechanisms are discussed in [FC-BGP-Protocol] and [FC-ARXIV]
   for details.
