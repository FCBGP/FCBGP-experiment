      Forwarding Commitment BGP Testbed and Deployment Experience
                    draft-li-fcbgp-experiment-latest

Abstract

   Forwarding Commitment BGP（FC-BGP） is capable of establishing a secure
   inter-domain system that can simultaneously authenticate AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE and validate network forwarding on the
   dataplane.  In an effort to enhance the validation of FC-BGP, a
   prototype implementation of the FC-BGP was developed and an
   evaluation was conducted on the FITI high-performance IPv6 backbone
   network, as well as on the network interconnecting Internet Exchange
   Points（IXPs）. This document reports on the prototype implementation
   and the results of the evaluation.

4.  FC-BGP Testbed

4.1.  FITI

   The prototypes of our solutions for FC-BGP are implemented and tested
   on FITI (Future Internet Technology Infrastructure).  FITI is a major
   Chinese science and technology infrastructure investment, which is
   now under construction and operation by 40 universities, including
   the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of
   Education and Tsinghua University.  FITI holds 4096 Autonomous System
   Numbers (ASNs) assigned by APNIC, along with a 240a:a000::/20 IPv6
   address block.  With sites distributed across China, it features a
   genuine internet environment suitable for large-scale network
   experimentation.  FITI supports a maximum bandwidth of up to 1.2
   Tbps.
